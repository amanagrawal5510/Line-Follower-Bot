# Line Follower Bot
It is basically a completely autonomus bot ,assembeld using Aurdino uno and some sensors.

The task of this bot is to complete the track laid with certain width of black strips , it have to follow the black strip until it reaches the final destination.

The is little easy for the robot so we added a challenge for the bot.The challenge is along with track completion it has to decode.

Along the track there are certain numbers of LEDs arranged in a row , among which some LEDs are on and rest are off.

Also at the end of the track there is barrier and certain number of flags(equal to the total number of LEDs).

So finally bot need to count the numbers of ON LEDs and hit the x numbered flag(where x = number of on leds) at the end of the track along with the track completion.

NOTE :- If you want to build only simple line follower bot skip the challenge part.But if not you choose whatever the challenge you want for the bot.In my case i am giving above mentioned challenege to the bot.
